# THIS LINE SHOULD BE REMOVED

This file will be displayed in the API’s card, so it must be between 80 and 150 characters long.

A good card’s summary would shortly describe the main purpose of the API.

Do NOT repeat the API’s name or vertical, as the user can already see it in the card’s title and the page’s breadcrumbs.
